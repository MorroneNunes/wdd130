    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <P>The purpose to Riding a Bike site it's to show for all people that back to learning something is completely amazing! 
    Even thought some of you have a different mind, we are here to help you to discover a incredible world when you are back to learn.

    <H3>Audience</H3>
    <p>So, Why this website it's so important for you? How this site will help you to give hopeless in back to learn?
        How can you start showing for another peaplo that back to learn is important?
        Well, let me asnwer these 3 questions in a unique asnwer! "Backing" to learn will show you that you really can do alot things that you can ever imagine!
        For exemple, In math we have many equations that we learnd in high school but many of us never apllied in our lives these equations, and because of it
        We lost our capacity to continuisly practicte and learn math. But when we back to learn and back to practicte continuisly, we notice some "takes" in our maind.
        That is the GROWTH MINDSET working on your mind. And the peoples that make a part of your life will notice it too.
